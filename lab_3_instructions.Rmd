### Objectives

* Learn the basics of using the ggplot function
* Go from data acquisition to visualization

### Instructions

* Review the in-class lab found in this project.
* Find a data set you find interesting.
* Create a visualization using the `ggplot` function in an R Markdown document.
* Write a short description explaining what you have done and why it is interesting.
* Upload the HTML file to Canvas.

### Notes on the assignment requirements

* This assignment requires exactly one visualization. You will lose 50% of remaining points for each additional visualization included. As an example, an assignment with two visualizations will be eligible for 50% of the points. An assignment with three will have a max score of 25% of the available points.
* Assignments that do not use `ggplot` will recieve 0 points.
* Your grade will be reduced by 10% if your explination of the plot does not match what the plot represents.
* 0 points will be awarded for answers not using R Markdown.
